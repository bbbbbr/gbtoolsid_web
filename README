This is the web version of a console tool that does the same thing:
https://github.com/bbbbbr/gbtoolsid

A self contained, local-only web app for identifying tools used to build Game Boy ROMs

It attempts to identify the toolchain and engine through binary fingerprints:
- GBDK 2.x and GBDK-2020
- ZGB
- GBStudio


Some example output:
